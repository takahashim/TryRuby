answer: ^\d{1,}$
ok:     Good! You did a bit of math. See how the answer popped out?
error:  Type 2 + 6 in the editor
---

The editor window at the bottom is where you type your Ruby code, hit the __Run__ button and
watch it run!

For example, try typing some math. Like:

    2 + 6

The output of your program should show itself at the output window at the top.
There should also be a line that tells you how well you did.

> Alternatively you can hit the __Copy__ button to copy the example code to the editor.
