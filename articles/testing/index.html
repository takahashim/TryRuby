<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Testing software is one of the most important aspects of software development. It ensures that the code
you are writing is doing what it is supposed to do. Now and in the future.  </p>

<p>Having a comprehensive set of tests for your code gives <strong>you</strong> confidence that it does what it is
supposed to do. It also helps bestow that confidence on <strong>others</strong>. Other people who are using or maintaining
your code.</p>

<p>Running tests some time after you created your code, for instance after some components you rely on have been
updated, will tell you if your code still works or you need to make changes.</p>

<h3>Different tests for different purposes</h3>

<p>There are a lot of different kinds of test. I&rsquo;ve list a couple here, in order in which they are used in a
real programming project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit tests<br>
Tests for individual methods, classes and modules.</li>
<li>Functional tests<br>
Does your code do what the end user expects ?</li>
<li>Integration tests<br>
Put all the individual pieces of code together. Does it still work and do what it should do ?</li>
<li>Performance tests<br>
Response times for one development user won&rsquo;t be a problem. What happens when 100 users are
using the software at the same time ?</li>
<li>Penetration tests<br>
Security needs to be built into your code from the start, but you should always test what happens
when a skilled penetration tester throws some unexpected input at your software.
How far can the pen-tester go ?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Waterfall versus Agile</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to explain in-depth what Waterfall and Agile means. You can look it up on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Basically, use the Waterfall method if: you are designing a spaceship to fly to Mars, some medical
device or anything that <strong>must work according to a specification</strong> with a minimal chance of errors.
This means analyzing, describing, documenting every aspect of the software before it is built.</p>

<p>If you are designing the next instant messaging platform, business app or anything where the <strong>exact
specifications are not known in advance</strong>, but will change along the way, use an Agile development
method.</p>

<p>The following topics are specific to Agile.</p>

<h3>TDD</h3>

<p>Test Driven Development: Write your tests first, then write your code.</p>

<p>When you develop a new piece of code or add a new function to existing code, first define a set of
tests that the final working code should pass. Next run the tests. Most likely all tests will fail.
Now start implementing and refactoring your code until all tests pass.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this way of working is that you focus first on <strong>what</strong> your code should do,
instead of on how it should work. In practice the effect is that you write less code.</p>

<h3>BDD</h3>

<p>Behavior Driven Development: an extension to TDD to include the clients functional requirements.</p>

<p>Before implementing any new code you need to know what the desired behavior of that code should
be. In other words what does the client, paying your bills, want.
This involves the client and the developer speaking the same language. A language also known as
plain English. BDD uses a fixed layout to write down <em>user stories</em>.</p>

<p>Here is an example copied from the
<a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Background" target="_blank">Cucumber</a>
documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feature:</strong> Multiple site support<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>As a</strong> Mephisto site owner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>I want to</strong> host blogs for different people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>In order to</strong> make gigantic piles of money  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Background:</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Given</strong> a global administrator named &ldquo;Greg&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>And</strong> a blog named &ldquo;Greg&rsquo;s anti-tax rants&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>And</strong> a customer named &ldquo;Dr. Bill&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>And</strong> a blog named &ldquo;Expensive Therapy&rdquo; owned by &ldquo;Dr. Bill&rdquo;  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Scenario:</strong> Dr. Bill posts to his own blog<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Given</strong> I am logged in as Dr. Bill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>When</strong> I try to post to &ldquo;Expensive Therapy&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Then</strong> I should see &ldquo;Your article was published.&rdquo;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each feature usually has many scenario&rsquo;s.</p>

<h3>Test tools and automation</h3>

<p>Ruby has one of the most advanced set of testing tools available anywhere.</p>

<p>For supporting TDD style testing <strong>rspec</strong> is very popular.
BDD style testing is often done with <strong>cucumber</strong>. Cucumber lets you translate functional
requirements written in plain English into executable (!) tests for your Ruby code.</p>

<p>Testing is not supposed to involve additional work. This would soon lead to less testing.
The answer is automating tests. When the test automation tool notices you have changed a (Ruby)
file, part or all of the tests are executed again. And you will be notified of newly failing or
passing tests.</p>

<p>Test automation can for instance be done with <strong>autotest</strong> or <strong>guard</strong>. Guard can automate lots
of other tasks for you as well.</p>
